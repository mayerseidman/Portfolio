has been very good at helping teachers track their students’ independent reading and motivating students to read more on their own. While Whooo’s Reading did a good job managing and motivating independent reading, we discovered that teachers and schools were most interested in WR because of the questions that ask students about the books they read.</p>\n                                    <img src={ comprehension } alt=\"\"/>\n\n                                    <p>We learned that teachers were fed up with the factual-recall multiple choice questions that programs would ask students.</p>\n                                    <img src={ multipleChoice } alt=\"\"/>\n                                    <p>Questions like these do not prepare students for a world in which they need to think creatively and analytically and one in which they can easily google the answer to fact-recall questions. Moreover the new standards ask students to synthesize, cite evidence, analyze, and write and these ‘old-school’ multiple choice assessments were not cutting it anymore. </p>\n                                    <p>As a result, we realized that the best way we could continue to help teachers with our program was by improving our reading questions and assessment content. To make these improvements, we turned to our teachers for their invaluable feedback and input.</p>\n                                </div>\n                            </Fade> \n                            <Fade bottom>   \n                                <div className=\"strategyContainer workSection\">\n                                    <p className=\"workHeader\">Research, Strategy, <span className=\"andText\">and</span> Concept</p>\n                                    <div className=\"discoveryContainer\">\n                                        <p className=\"subHeader\"><b>General Discovery</b></p>\n                                        <p>For two weeks we had phone calls with dozens of teachers around the country and learned that a major problem is finding formative assessments that align with the standards and reinforce the reading units they teach. While some sites (e.g. Pinterest) offer graphic organizers and other forms of assessments-- it often takes many hours to find the right types of reading exercises and they rarely are engaging for students. In fact nearly every teacher we spoke to brought up some version of this problem. </p>\n                                        <p>\n                                            <i>\"I might have a student who is missing a particular skill: maybe inferring, drawing conclusions, answering open ended questions, main ideas, supporting details, using evidence.

Then I break them into groups of 4 so they can start getting practice and so they can give support to each other. \n                                           <br/> <br/> The worst part of this process is coming up with activities for the 3 or 4 person groups and grading them.
